> 🦄 Yes — I know\... _another_ project. It can't be helped! I really do plan on finishing them all (at some point). So, since I'm already over-worked and short on time as-is.

🧭 Quirky, snarky, _absolutely-not-your-typical_ travel planner for finding the coolest, least obvious spots — the ones the big travel sites forgot.

Underfoot helps you find hidden gems in any given location by digging into local blogs, indie magazines, and offbeat sources. No TripAdvisor Top 10 lists here — we're all about the "Wait, this exists?!" moments.
