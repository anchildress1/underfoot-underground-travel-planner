# Artifact Retention Policy:
# - Test artifacts (coverage, reports): 7 days - sufficient for PR review cycle
# - Security artifacts: 30 days - compliance and audit requirements
# Cache Requirements:
# - Requires package-lock.json in root directory for npm cache to function
# - setup-node@v6 automatically caches npm with 'cache: npm' parameter
